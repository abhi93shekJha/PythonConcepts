## Miscellaneous Concepts
### pdb (Python Debugger)
- import pdb, we can debug using terminal.
- pdb.set_trace(), we add this method, whereever we want to stop the debugger.
- this is same as using debugger in an IDE.
- from terminal, when in debugging environment, we can add commands like,
- step (moves to next line and executes the previous line of code)
- a (list out all the variables, till the executed code)
- we can assign a variable, a different value
- help (list out all the commands available)
- help any_command (gives details about any command)
